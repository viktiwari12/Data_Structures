    <!--Let's make a simple bloging page using HTML only -->
    <!-- The page flow will be as follow -->
    <!-- First Part-->
        <!--Header -->
        <h1>This is the heading of the paragrah </h1>
            <!--Logo Website Link -->
            <!--Header Image -->
            For now we are ignoring the image part
    <!--Main Part Blog Heading --> 
        <!--Blog Image-->
        <!-- Content -->
        <!-- since the html doesn't read enter key, so to seperate any text in two lines we use br tag. 
        unlike other tags it doesn't have a pair. -->
        <br> <br> <br>  
        Here is the content of the blog. It could be any text. 
            <!-- Paragraph 1  
                The texts written as a paragraph are enclosed as p tags 
                The p tags seperates one paragraph from another paragraph-->
            <p>This is the first paragraph </p>
            <!-- Paragraph  -->
            <p> This is another paragraph
                <br>
                Here we  want to use some extra space in between the texts  <!-- to do so we will use &nbsp --> &nbsp text with some extra space  
                
            </p>
            <p> 
                This is an another paragraph containing some lists- both ordered and unordered list. <br>  
                Below are some unordered lists: 
                <!-- To make unordered lists we use ul tag -->
                <ul>This is an unordered list 
                    <li>This is a list in unordered list </li>
                    <li>This is another list in unordered list</li>
                    <ul>This is an another unordered list in previous unordered list.
                        <li>Further a list</li>
                        <!-- One thing that has to be noticed here is if we put a li tag it's coming as a bullet points   -->
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <!-- One more thing that has to be noticed here lists are sometimes appearing  as a bullet points like sometime as a dark circle or sometime as a hallow circle
                    what's an intresting fact here is we can manually decide how we want to present the lists by using "type attribute " 
                    we will learn about this now  -->
                <ul  type="square">This is a seperate unordered list
                    <li >This is a list with square </li>
                    <li>This is an additional list  </li>
                    <li>This too is an additional list</li>
                </ul>  
                <!-- similar to unordered list we also have an ordered list  -->
                <ol>This is an ordered list 
                    <li>This is a list in unordered list </li>
                    <li>This is another list in unordered list</li>
                    <ol >This is an another unordered list in previous unordered list.
                        <li>Further a list</li>
                        
                    </ol>
                </ol>
                <!-- One more thing that has to be noticed here lists are starting always with "1"
                    what's an intresting fact here is we can manually decide how we want to present the lists by using "type attribute " 
                    we will learn about this now  -->
                <ol  type="a">This is a seperate unordered list 
                    <li >This is a list with square </li>
                    <li>This is an additional list  </li>
                    <li>This too is an additional list</li>
                </ol>  
            </p>
            </p>
             <!-- List  -->
        <!-- Ending paragraph -->
